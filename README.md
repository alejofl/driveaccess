# Drive Access

**Drive Access** is a Google Chrome extension that changes accounts automatically, when you don't have permission to open a file or folder.

## How it Works

You just need to have the account added to Chrome, and the extension will do the rest of the work.

To add a new account to Google Chrome just click on the profile picture in any Google tab, click on "Add another account", and follow the onscreen instructions.

## How to Install

1. Download the repository.
2. In Google Chrome Search Bar, type `chrome://extensions`.
3. Turn on the Developer Mode, by clicking on the switch on the right top of the page.
4. Click on "Load Unpacked".
5. Choose the folder of the extension.
